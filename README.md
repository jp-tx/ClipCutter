# ClipCutter

This is a simple video cutter, you open a video file, navigate to where you want the start of the new file, click start, navigate to the new end, click end, and then click save. It's a simple piece of software, no more features intended, but sometimes you don't need to open an over the top editing program for something that should be simple. Offline, secure, and you don't need to sign up with an email to use it, free forever, uses ffmpeg under the hood, only windows for now
